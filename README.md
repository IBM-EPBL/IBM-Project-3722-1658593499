Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease using Machine Learning


Project Description:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests we take for
different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which
attributes may contain helpful information about the disease. The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem and we make use of such 
information to build a machine learning model that predicts Chronic Kidney Disease.
